  <p>The Alcoholics Assembly Fantasy League (AAFL) was founded in 2017, when 10 close friends decided to embark on the journey of dynasty fantasy football.
  Once a redraft league, the challenge was not enough.</p>
  <p>This league is not just about the money, it is a way for 10 friends to stay in consistent contact with each other as life brings us to unknown terrorties...and of course the year long bragging rights over our fellow friends.</p>
  <p>The AAFL is currently a 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, 1 DEF league, with TE premium scoring.  Starting with the 2022 season, it will be a Superflex, Tight End premium scoring league and the elimination of both K and DEF, entering a new FLEX position to the starting lineup.</p>
  <p>So far, we have had 4 seperate winners:
    <ul>
      <li>2017: Matt Best</li>
      <li>2018: Cody Dewrell</li>
      <li>2019: Nate Yoakum</li>
      <li>2020: Austin Schmidt</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Check back for consistent updates, trasactions, matchups, and more!</p>
