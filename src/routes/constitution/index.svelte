	<h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={one}>Section 1: Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a DYNASTY league.  Owners are expected to commit to playing in this league for the foreseeable future.  The intent of this league is to give us a chance to continue to play fantasy football together for years to come in a more realistic football setting.  Turnover of ownership will result in the slow dismantlement of the league, so please consider this before committing.  If there is a problem with your continued ownership please notify the league and we will work on a way for you to stay or a replacement if necessary.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a 10 team league with no divisions.  This ensures the top players make the playoffs and draft order is easily seen.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a TE Premium league (1.0pts per reception) and will become a SuperFlex league starting with the 2022 season.</li>
            <li>The league season will begin from Week 1 of the NFL regular season and conclude with the championship ending at Week 17 (amended from Week 16 after the increase in games).</li>
            <li>Collusion will NOT be tolerated and will result in immediate proposals for expulsion to the league.</li>
            <li>If there are any rules that an owner would like to bring up for discussion, they may do so by:
                <ul>
                <li>Contacting the league commissioner with the rule they want changed</li>
                <li>Provide a solution to the rule change</li>
                <li>From here, a league vote will occur in which 51%+ must agree to the change for it to take effect immediately</li>
                <li>Vote will take place during Rookie/FA Draft Weekend</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    	<h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2: Finances</h2>
    	<h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 League Dues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Owners are required to pay $125 to the league treasurer by the start of that yearâ€™s Rookie/FA Draft.</li>
            <li>Failure to pay or set up a payment plan with the league treasurer will result in forfeiting all winnings won that season, as well as a forfeiture of all draft picks until paid.</li>
        </ul>
    	<h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Payout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st Place: $705 + extra not used for league expenses</li>
            <li>2nd Place: $100</li>
            <li>3rd Place: $0</li>
            <li>Weekly Winner: $15/week</li>
            <li>Trophy Nameplate: $10</li>
        </ul>
	<h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3: League Ownership</h2>
    	<h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Buy Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An owner that wants to leave the league must do so only after a new owner has been found AND the previous owner will pay the entry fee for the new owner for the following year.</li>
	    <li>If an owner no longer wants to participate in the AAFL, a new owner will be sought out by the entire league.</li>
            <li>If there are multiple options, a league vote will be held for all the nominations for possible new owners.  The owner with above a 50% acceptance rate will then be announced as the new owner barring acceptance.</li>
    	</ul>

    	</ul>
    	<p class="underscore">Taxi Squad</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Taxi Squads will compile of 3 players of either ROOKIES or SOPHOMORES.</li>
        	<li>Taxi Squads are locked during the season, only editable in the offseason or if an owner trades for a player on another ownerâ€™s Taxi Squad.</li>
        	<li>If you activate a player on your own Taxi Squad, you can not move them back and must account for that space on your active roster.</li>

    	<h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Future Notes</h3>
    	<p class="underscore">Super Flex</p>

        	<li>Starting with the 2022 season, the FLEX position will be changed to a SuperFlex position.</li>
        	<li>Owners will have the chance to start a QB, RB, WR, or TE in this spot.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p class="underscore">Offseason</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>In the Offseason, rosters will be expanded from 27 to 33 to accommodate new free agent pickups and drafted players.  There will be no IR spots available so all previous IR players will count towards the 30 roster limit.  Owners will cut rosters down from 33 to 27 by 11:59PM on the Sunday before Week One of the NFL season.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p class="underscore">Retirement</p>
    	<ul>
		<li>In the event that a player retires, the current owner may drop the player.  They reserve the right of first refusal for 1 year after they are dropped to pick them back up if the player in question re-joins the NFL.  If the player re-joins, that owner has 1 week to pick up that player.  After that week the player is officially a free agent and open to all owners.</li>

            <li>Each owner will be given a salary of $200 to fill out the team as they please.</li>
            <li>Players will be nominated in order of their finish in the 2017 March Madness Bracket.</li>
            <li>Bidding Process:
                <ul>
                    <li>A player is nominated with a bid of at least $0, in which other owners are then allowed to bid themselves</li>
                    <li>There is no minimum bid, so you are allowed to bid $0</li>
                    <li>A countdown clock of 1:30 will thus begin</li>
                    <li>Once the clock is under :10, the clock will reset to :10 with every following bid</li>
                    <li>Owners will be allowed to bid until there are no other bidders left, in which they are awarded that player</li>
                    <li>If all owners reach $0 without all rosters filled, it will begin a standard draft with all owners still in need of players until all rosters are completely filled out</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once completed, the league commissioner will input the results into the league platform.</li>

            <li>All new NFL rookies will be available in this draft, along with all Free Agents from the previous fantasy season.</li>
            <li>One week before draft day, owners must have open spots for all future draft picks they have.  If an owner has more picks than can legally roster, they must either cut players or forfeit picks in order to not go over their 33 man roster limit.  All players cut will be immediately available in the R/FA draft and picks forfeited will be skipped during the draft.</li>
            <li>The draft will NOT be a snake draft. It will be a standard draft (i.e. NFL draft).</li>
            <li>If a team has traded a pick, that pick will then be given to the correct team once their draft order is in place.</li>

            <li>FAAB during offseason pickups will be taken from your yearly FAAB budget.</li>
            <li>Free agents will exist throughout the year.  They will be locked for the week at the start of their game.</li>

            <li>Bids are accepted starting early Tuesday morning until Wednesday at 6am</li>

    	<h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={nine}>Section 9 Trades</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trades of players & draft picks both will be allowed.</li>
            <li>Trades may only involve players & picks.</li>
            <li>Draft picks involved in a trade will only be allowed up to 2 years out.  This prevents owners from trading draft picks so far in the future that can affect other/new owners if they quit the league.</li>
            <li>Trade of future draft picks of equal rounds is considered a bet, resulting in a nullification of that trade (i.e. trading next years first round picks straight up before the picks are determined).</li>

        <ul>
            <li>This is a DYNASTY league.  Owners are expected to commit to playing in this league for the foreseeable future.  The intent of this league is to give us a chance to continue to play fantasy football together for years to come in a more realistic football setting.  Turnover of ownership will result in the slow dismantlement of the league, so please consider this before committing.  If there is a problem with your continued ownership please notify the league and we will work on a way for you to stay or a replacement if necessary.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a 10 team league with no divisions.  This ensures the top players make the playoffs and draft order is easily seen.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a TE Premium league (1.0pts per reception) and will become a SuperFlex league starting with the 2022 season.</li>
            <li>The league season will begin from Week 1 of the NFL regular season and conclude with the championship ending at Week 17 (amended from Week 16 after the increase in games).</li>
            <li>Collusion will NOT be tolerated and will result in immediate proposals for expulsion to the league.</li>
            <li>If there are any rules that an owner would like to bring up for discussion, they may do so by:
                <ul>
                <li>Contacting the league commissioner with the rule they want changed</li>
                <li>Provide a solution to the rule change</li>
                <li>From here, a league vote will occur in which 51%+ must agree to the change for it to take effect immediately</li>
                <li>Vote will take place during Rookie/FA Draft Weekend</li>
                </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>An owner that wants to leave the league must do so only after a new owner has been found AND the previous owner will pay the entry fee for the new owner for the following year.</li>
	    <li>If an owner no longer wants to participate in the AAFL, a new owner will be sought out by the entire league.</li>
            <li>If there are multiple options, a league vote will be held for all the nominations for possible new owners.  The owner with above a 50% acceptance rate will then be announced as the new owner barring acceptance.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A startup auction draft will be held on September 3, 2017 to begin our new transition from Re-Draft FFL to a Dynasty FFL.  Location is at Manny Savasâ€™ house.  Time of start will be determined day-of.  This will be a live draft.</li>
            <li>Each owner will be given a salary of $200 to fill out the team as they please.</li>
            <li>Players will be nominated in order of their finish in the 2017 March Madness Bracket.</li>
            <li>Bidding Process:
                <ul>
                    <li>A player is nominated with a bid of at least $0, in which other owners are then allowed to bid themselves</li>
                    <li>There is no minimum bid, so you are allowed to bid $0</li>
                    <li>A countdown clock of 1:30 will thus begin</li>
                    <li>Once the clock is under :10, the clock will reset to :10 with every following bid</li>
                    <li>Owners will be allowed to bid until there are no other bidders left, in which they are awarded that player</li>
                    <li>If all owners reach $0 without all rosters filled, it will begin a standard draft with all owners still in need of players until all rosters are completely filled out</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once completed, the league commissioner will input the results into the league platform.</li>

            <li>One week before draft day, owners must have open spots for all future draft picks they have.  If an owner has more picks than can legally roster, they must either cut players or forfeit picks in order to not go over their 33 man roster limit.  All players cut will be immediately available in the R/FA draft and picks forfeited will be skipped during the draft.</li>
            <li>The draft will NOT be a snake draft. It will be a standard draft (i.e. NFL draft).</li>
            <li>If a team has traded a pick, that pick will then be given to the correct team once their draft order is in place.</li>

            <li>Trades may only involve players & picks.</li>
            <li>Draft picks involved in a trade will only be allowed up to 2 years out.  This prevents owners from trading draft picks so far in the future that can affect other/new owners if they quit the league.</li>
            <li>Trade of future draft picks of equal rounds is considered a bet, resulting in a nullification of that trade (i.e. trading next years first round picks straight up before the picks are determined).</li>
