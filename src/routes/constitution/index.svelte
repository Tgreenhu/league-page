    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={one}>Section 1: Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a DYNASTY league.  Owners are expected to commit to playing in this league for the foreseeable future.  The intent of this league is to give us a chance to continue to play fantasy football together for years to come in a more realistic football setting.  Turnover of ownership will result in the slow dismantlement of the league, so please consider this before committing.  If there is a problem with your continued ownership please notify the league and we will work on a way for you to stay or a replacement if necessary.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a 10 team league with no divisions.  This ensures the top players make the playoffs and draft order is easily seen.</li>
            <li>AAFL is a TE Premium league (1.0pts per reception) and will become a SuperFlex league starting with the 2022 season.</li>
            <li>The league season will begin from Week 1 of the NFL regular season and conclude with the championship ending at Week 17 (amended from Week 16 after the increase in games).</li>
            <li>Collusion will NOT be tolerated and will result in immediate proposals for expulsion to the league.</li>
            <li>If there are any rules that an owner would like to bring up for discussion, they may do so by:
                <ul>
                <li>Contacting the league commissioner with the rule they want changed</li>
                <li>Provide a solution to the rule change</li>
                <li>From here, a league vote will occur in which 51%+ must agree to the change for it to take effect immediately</li>
                <li>Vote will take place during Rookie/FA Draft Weekend</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2: Finances</h2>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 League Dues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Owners are required to pay $125 to the league treasurer by the start of that yearâ€™s Rookie/FA Draft.</li>
            <li>Failure to pay or set up a payment plan with the league treasurer will result in forfeiting all winnings won that season, as well as a forfeiture of all draft picks until paid.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Payout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st Place: $705 + extra not used for league expenses</li>
            <li>2nd Place: $100</li>
            <li>3rd Place: $0</li>
            <li>Weekly Winner: $15/week</li>
            <li>Trophy Nameplate: $10</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3: League Ownership</h2>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Buy Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An owner that wants to leave the league must do so only after a new owner has been found AND the previous owner will pay the entry fee for the new owner for the following year.</li>
	    <li>If an owner no longer wants to participate in the AAFL, a new owner will be sought out by the entire league.</li>
            <li>If there are multiple options, a league vote will be held for all the nominations for possible new owners.  The owner with above a 50% acceptance rate will then be announced as the new owner barring acceptance.</li>
    	</ul>

    <p class="underscore">IR</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Each team will also have 2 Reserve spots for players that qualify.  These spots do not count as the 25 and if a player is activated off of the Reserve spot an active player must then be dropped to add them to your team.</li>
    	</ul>
    <p class="underscore">Taxi Squad</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Taxi Squads will compile of 3 players of either ROOKIES or SOPHOMORES.</li>
        	<li>Taxi Squads are locked during the season, only editable in the offseason or if an owner trades for a player on another ownerâ€™s Taxi Squad.</li>
        	<li>If you activate a player on your own Taxi Squad, you can not move them back and must account for that space on your active roster.</li>
    	</ul>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Future Notes</h3>
    <p class="underscore">Super Flex</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Starting with the 2022 season, the FLEX position will be changed to a SuperFlex position.</li>
        	<li>Owners will have the chance to start a QB, RB, WR, or TE in this spot.</li>
    	</ul>
    <p class="underscore">Offseason</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>In the Offseason, rosters will be expanded from 27 to 33 to accommodate new free agent pickups and drafted players.  There will be no IR spots available so all previous IR players will count towards the 30 roster limit.  Owners will cut rosters down from 33 to 27 by 11:59PM on the Sunday before Week One of the NFL season.</li>
    	</ul>
    <p class="underscore">Retirement</p>
    	<ul>
		<li>In the event that a player retires, the current owner may drop the player.  They reserve the right of first refusal for 1 year after they are dropped to pick them back up if the player in question re-joins the NFL.  If the player re-joins, that owner has 1 week to pick up that player.  After that week the player is officially a free agent and open to all owners.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A startup auction draft will be held on September 3, 2017 to begin our new transition from Re-Draft FFL to a Dynasty FFL.  Location is at Manny Savasâ€™ house.  Time of start will be determined day-of.  This will be a live draft.</li>
            <li>Each owner will be given a salary of $200 to fill out the team as they please.</li>
            <li>Players will be nominated in order of their finish in the 2017 March Madness Bracket.</li>
            <li>Bidding Process:
                <ul>
                    <li>A player is nominated with a bid of at least $0, in which other owners are then allowed to bid themselves</li>
                    <li>There is no minimum bid, so you are allowed to bid $0</li>
                    <li>A countdown clock of 1:30 will thus begin</li>
                    <li>Once the clock is under :10, the clock will reset to :10 with every following bid</li>
                    <li>Owners will be allowed to bid until there are no other bidders left, in which they are awarded that player</li>
                    <li>If all owners reach $0 without all rosters filled, it will begin a standard draft with all owners still in need of players until all rosters are completely filled out</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once completed, the league commissioner will input the results into the league platform.</li>

            <li>This will be a 5 round draft.</li>
            <li>All new NFL rookies will be available in this draft, along with all Free Agents from the previous fantasy season.</li>
            <li>One week before draft day, owners must have open spots for all future draft picks they have.  If an owner has more picks than can legally roster, they must either cut players or forfeit picks in order to not go over their 33 man roster limit.  All players cut will be immediately available in the R/FA draft and picks forfeited will be skipped during the draft.</li>
            <li>The draft will NOT be a snake draft. It will be a standard draft (i.e. NFL draft).</li>
            <li>If a team has traded a pick, that pick will then be given to the correct team once their draft order is in place.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 Draft Order</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>All players not drafted will become free agents after the draft.</li>
            <li>Waivers are ran early Wednesday morning (via Sleeper standard).</li>
            <li>FAAB during offseason pickups will be taken from your yearly FAAB budget.</li>
            <li>Free agents will exist throughout the year.  They will be locked for the week at the start of their game.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={eightOne}>8.1 FAAB</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We will be using a FAAB for any free agent pickups</li>
            <li>Each team will have $100 FAAB points/year to spend on free agent pickups</li>
            <li>This is a blind bid where the highest bid is awarded to the player, and all other bids are then given back to their respective teams</li>
            <li>Bids are accepted starting early Tuesday morning until Wednesday at 6am</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={nine}>Section 9 Trades</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trades of players & draft picks both will be allowed.</li>
            <li>Trades may only involve players & picks.</li>
            <li>Draft picks involved in a trade will only be allowed up to 2 years out.  This prevents owners from trading draft picks so far in the future that can affect other/new owners if they quit the league.</li>
            <li>Trade of future draft picks of equal rounds is considered a bet, resulting in a nullification of that trade (i.e. trading next years first round picks straight up before the picks are determined).</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={nineOne}>9.1 Drug Rule</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If a trade is made with one or more owners under the influence of a drug (alcohol, weed, medicine, etc) or in an impaired state, that trade will stay on the table for 24 hours</li>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense â€“ Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 80%</li>
            <li>Second Offense â€“ Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 18 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids</li>
            <li>Third Offense â€“ A league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFive}>1.2.5 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 7 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a backup kicker). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>

    <p>Rokkie drafts will consist of 3 round of drafting, with 5 minutes alotted for each pick. To make room for the incoming players, benches will be expanded by (5) spots. These spots will be removed in mid-August, at which point you will need to have cut the necessary players.</p>
    <p>Any spots not filled during the draft, can be filled immediately afterwards from the waiver wire.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical .5PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>

    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: {dues * 8}$</li>
        <li>2nd place: {dues * 3}$</li>
        <li>3rd place: {dues}$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A â…” majority vote is required in order to raise league dues. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>
